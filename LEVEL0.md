# Generic Tasks

## TASK 1: 3D Printing

Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an
STL file, and then learn to slice it (using ultimaker or creality slicer).Learn about bed
temperature, infill density and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and
slice it and put it for print.

● [PLA settings](https://standardprintco.com/read/pla-filament-printing-guide-how-to-succeed-printing-pla-and-troubleshooting-common-problems-step-by-step)

● [How printer works](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-3d-printing-and-how-exactly-does-it-work/aa/)

(Note this task is to be done under coordinator supervision.)


## TASK 2: API

What is an API? [Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) the working of an API and its applications. Using any api of your choice,
build an user interface(web app, mobile app, etc), where you can make calls and then display
the necessary information. An example weather app is given below, using the open weather api.

## TASK 3: Working with Github

Familiarize yourself with GitHub integrated workflows (GitHub actions), Issues, and pull requests
with this task. Given below is a git repository, go check it out and then perform the necessary
tasks stated in the readme file.

## TASK 4: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu and do the following subtasks:
● Create a folder named test.

● cd into that folder.

● Create a blank file without using any text editor.

● list the files in that folder

● create 2600 folders in this folder where each folder is named like . For example, M90 or
B56.

● concatenate two text files containing any random text and display them on the terminal.

## TASK 5: Kaggle contest
Make a kaggle account, visit the website and complete the competition

Participate in the Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML
competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.The competition is
simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the
Titanic shipwreck.

## TASK 6: Working with Pandas and Matplotlib:

Using pandas and matplotlib, and a dataset of your choice, plot a line graph, bar graph, and
scatter plot.

## TASK 7: Create a Portfolio Webpage

Create a website to showcase your portfolio - about yourself, interests, projects, social media
profiles and more. It has to be responsive and also pushed to the git repository. CSS can be of
your choice and any framework can be used.


## TASK 8: Writing Resource Article using Markdown

Markdown is an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting
elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without the use of a formal text editor or
the use of HTML tags. Markdown is device agnostic and displays the writing format consistently
across device type.
Write a technical resource article on a topic of your choice and post it on the MARVEL website.
Refer to the linked article for further details

## TASK 9: Tinkercad
Create a tinkercad account, get familiar with the application, understand the example circuits given and simulate a simple circuit using an ultrasonic sensor to estimate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor. Display the results on the serial monitor.
 
Create a radar system utilising an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to detect objects within a certain range. The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures the time taken for them to bounce back, while the servo motor rotates the sensor to cover a wider area, providing a simple yet effective detection mechanism.

 TASK OUTCOME: introduction to-
·        TINKERCAD
·        Working of ultrasonic sensor and servo motor
·        Radar technology
PRECAUTIONS/SAFETY MEASURES- NOT ANY




 
## TASK 10: Speed Control of DC Motor

Explore basic techniques for controlling DC motors, understand the control DC motors using the
L298N motor driver and the Arduino board. Using an UNO and H-Bridge L298N motor driver,
control the speed of a 5V BO motor, try simulating this on tinkercad and then perform it on the
hardware, Record videos of you doing the same.

## TASK 11: LED Toggle Using ESP32

Learn the working of an ESP32 and create a standalone web server with an ESP32 that
controls the LED connected with ESP32 GPIOs. Use the arduino IDE to code and upload the
program to the ESP32. Learn to configure the IDE to upload code to an ESP32.

## TASK 12: Soldering Prerequisites

(Soldering is to be done in presence of a coordinator)

Learn about the soldering equipment present in our lab, the solder, the soldering iron, soldering
wick, flux, etc. Learn to use them and perform basic soldering on a perf board, for example a
LED circuit in the presence of a coordinator and document the same.

## TASK 13:

Design a 555 astable multivibrator with duty cycle 60%, rig up the circuit on a breadboard and
by using the probes observe the output of your circuit on the DSO.

## TASK 14: Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the logic circuit

Description: For 4 cases, based on door lock/open and key pressed/not pressed. Determine the
karnaugh map and make a burglar alarm using simple logic circuits. The buzzer or led blinks
when certain conditions are met, you can use push buttons for the door and key.

(Tip: use logic gates, use k-maps to figure out the working conditions.)


## TASK 15: Active Participation:

Take part in any technical event, inter or intra college and submit the issued certificate of
participation.

Enroll for a MOOC and complete the course.

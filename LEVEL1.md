Takeaways : Learn to create a website so that its easier to create a webserver.

## Task 4 - ESP32 CAM Based Surveillance Robot using Arduino IDE
Specific and customised task description * (Very important) - Use an ESP32 cam implementing L298N control for movement, setting up a live video streaming server, and enabling remote control functionality through Wi-Fi. Upload the video captured by the esp32cam on the MARVEL website 
(Specific part is instead of the motor driver  in the website they have to use L298N motor driver hence circuit will change and even the code a little bit)

Resource link :

https://iotdesignpro.com/projects/esp32-cam-surveillance-robot-car

Expected task outcomes*- The goal is to create a versatile surveillance robot capable of capturing and transmitting live video feed while being remotely controllable for surveillance applications.


Precautions/Safety measures/process for completing task- NILL

Any equipment/software to be purchased for the task which is not in the kit currently?*- most ftdi programmer and some of the ESP32 cams are not working properly hence to fix thet we have to do something 

Cost and sustainability plan (how would people be able to complete your task 10 years down the line) - initially we have to invest some in ESP32 cam and the fdti  programmer for now we have chasseies in marvel and 2 wheels which can be used.




##  Task 5 - MQTT PUBLISH AND SUBSCRIBE USING CLOUD MQTT


Specific and customised task description * (Very important) - Utilise MQTT LENS or any mqtt platform to establish MQTT publishing and subscribing functionalities. Upon publishing a message to turn on the 3 LED, ensure that subscribers receive the message and activate the particular led at a certain time LED accordingly.
Ex.LED 1 ON - Should on the first led only
SIMILARLY FOR LED 2 AND FOR 3
 
LED 1 OFF - Should off the first led only
SIMILARLY FOR LED 2 AND FOR 3
 
specifications- the resource is for one led on and off I gave it for 3 leds


Takeaways : Learn about the different protocols used in IOT.
Resource Links* - 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=deIRY5NxXo4





Expected task outcomes*- Upon successfully implementing MQTT publishing and subscribing using MQTT-LENS or any MQTT PUBLISHER, the LED will turn on and off when a particular message is published, demonstrating seamless communication and control over the LED device Using MQTT.

Precautions/Safety measures/process for completing task- NILL

Any equipment/software to be purchased for the task which is not in the kit currently?*- (optional cloud mqtt subscription)

Cost and sustainability plan (how would people be able to complete your task 10 years down the line) - if we need to use cloud mqtt there are some tiers of prising for it if it needed to be used properly. We can also use offline mqtt services which students can figure out or which is given is resource mqtt lens

(The link only tells us about the publish and subscribe model on the mqtt thence for this task we have to turn on and off the light using mqtt)



##  Task 6 - Sending data to ThingSpeak
Using Esp32 post the data of a temperature sensor to the Thingspeak Website using its api and display the graph of temp vs time and after processing retrieve the data back from the website.

Alternatively you can also use matplotlib in python to plot the graph of temp vs time, by downloading the dataset from thingspeak.

[Resource 2](https://nothans.com/thingspeak-tutorials/arduino/send-data-to-thingspeak-with-arduino)

Takeaways : Learn how to publish data to website and get data from it



##   Task 7 - Communication using I2C protocol

Send data from Esp32 to Arduino via I2C protocol and display a message on the lcd screen by typing the message using the webserver hosted on the esp32.

What is [I2C protocol](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-the-i2c-protocol-in-computer-network#:~:text=I2C%20stands%20for%20the%20inter,device%20has%20a%20specific%20address.)?

[Resource](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/i2c-from-esp32-to-arduino/975652)

Takeaways : Learn the wired communication protocol between two microcontrollers.



## Task 8 - Flashing Morse Code 

Set up an ESP32 to flash morse code using an led making use of the message sent by the webserver hosted on the esp32.

Measure the moisture level of the soil in the pot using the capacitive soil moisture sensor and display the moisture level on the serial monitor or on the LCD screen. Give an alert to the user if the soil moisutre level is below a certain level. 

[Resource](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-soil-moisture-sensor).

Takeaways : Learn to measure soil moisture and control the water level.


## Task 10 - Read and Display Vitals

Measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels using MAX30100 sensor and display the results on an Android Application using MIT App Inventor. Give a notification to the user if the heart rate or the oxygen level is out of the normal range. The app can communicate with the ESP32 using a webserver or using MQTT protocol.
